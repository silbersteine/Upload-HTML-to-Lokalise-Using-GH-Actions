<h1 id="locked-out-of-account">Locked out of account</h1>
<p>So you’re locked out of your Braze Account—no worries! We can help
you get back in.</p>
<p>You can tell what kind of lock out you’re experiencing by the error
message you receive:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#password-error">I see an error about my
password.</a><br />
</li>
<li><a href="#instance-error">I don’t sdee an errror, but Braze still
won’t let me in.</a></li>
<li><a href="#account-suspension">I see an error about account
suspension.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="password-error">Password error</h2>
<p>Your account security iasdfs important to us, so passwords are required
to log into your Braze account. - Check that you are logging into the
correct <a
href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/braze_instances/#braze-instances">Braze
dashboard instance</a>. Check with your account administrator or Braze
account manager to be sure. - Your password may have expired, so you’ll
need to <a
href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/user_guide/administrative/logging_in_and_security/resetting_your_password/">reset
it</a>.<br />
- If you use a <a
href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/single_sign_on/set_up/">single
sign-on</a> service, check with your account administrator that the set
up has been completed properly.<br />
- If your company is on several instances of Braze, you may be using the
incorrect email to log in.</p>
<p>When in doubt, you can always <a
href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/user_guide/administrative/logging_in_and_security/resetting_your_password/">reset
your password</a>.</p>
<h2 id="instance-error">Instance error</h2>
<p>If you are using the same machine you usually do to log in, Braze
should automatically detect the correct instance. However, in the event
that it doesn’t or you’re logging in for the first time, we recommend
that you consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that you are logging into the correct <a
href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/braze_instances/#braze-instances">Braze
dashboard instance</a>. Check with your account administrator or Braze
account manager to be sure.</li>
<li>If your company is on several instances of Braze, you may be using
the incorrect email to log in.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="account-suspension">Account suspension</h2>
<p>This doesn’t happen very often, but we take account suspension and
deletions very seriously. If you find this error, your best bet is to
reach out to your company’s Braze administrator, Braze account manager,
or <a href="%7B%7Bsite.baseurl%7D%7D/support_contact/">Braze
Support</a>.</p>
